# Creating Sample LogApp

- In this repo, I create a sample  Application that logs the individual's personal information and the date and time he/she visits the place. Only users with an admin account can view the list of individuals who visited the premises.

## Installation
- On creating sample log application we needed a database app for us to store the data that the users input where an admin user account can view the data stored.
- There are so many database applications that we can use but in my case, I used phpmyadmin which is easy to utilize.

### _*phpmyadmin*_

> In using phpmyadmin you don't need to install it to your computer in order to use. All you need is open your computer browser's tab and type [localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ "phpmyadmin") and you can freely start creating your own database.

> You can also choose to use [freesqldatabase](https://www.freesqldatabase.com/ "freesqldatabase"), It also directly connected to phpmyadmin. All you need to do is first create an account in freesqldatabase and then log in to popup phpmyadmin tab. All of the information that you're going to input is sent to your email.
